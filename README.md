# Bachelor-Project

From 2013 until 2017 I was bachelor student at Isfahan University of Technology. My bachelor project is about Interner of Things. I study multiple formal and informal resources to learn how it works and how to design a better platform for IoT.

Finally I decided to use Publish/Subscribe approach thorough my project and selected MQTT protocol as the main tool to do it.

Documentation is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/733amir/Bachelor-Project/master/IoT-Platform-with-MQTT-by-Amir-Khazaie.pdf).

Any questions? Email me -> Amir Khazaie (733amir@gmail.com)
